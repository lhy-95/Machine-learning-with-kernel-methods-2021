# Machine-learning-with-kernel-methods-2021
Here are the codes for the data challenge of Machine learning with kernel methods 2021. Our team name is LHY&amp;ZZ.

The notebook `spectrum kernel_normalized.ipynb` used the normalized spectrum kernel on the sequential DNA data.

The notebook `spectrum and mismatch kernel.ipynb` used the one mismatch kernel on the dataset1, and combien the result of dataset 0 and 2 from  notebook `spectrum kernel_normalized.ipynb`.
